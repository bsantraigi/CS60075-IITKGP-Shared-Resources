## Task Description, Baseline model and where to start
### Multilingual Question Answering (MQA)
https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLQA 

https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tydiqa

Task is : Giving an answer from a passage based on the question.
* During training you can use more than one language data. 
* Use Multingual pre-trained language model
* Members: 3-4 members

Students are requested to implement the base models using [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) and [XLM](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) models of the [tydi-QA](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tydiqa) gold passage dataset. Please find the below points to train the multilingual model. You can use this [code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/question-answering).
1. Train your model using the Tydi-QA gold passage train dataset(which contains 9 languages) and evaluate the Tydia-QA dataset dev data (only Hindi and Bengali)
2. Extract English, Hindi, and Bengali from the Tydi-QA gold passage train dataset to train the base models, and evaluate the Tydia-QA dataset dev data (only Hindi and Bengali). 

### SemEval-2022 Task 11: Multilingual Complex Name Entity Recognition:

* Members: 4-5 members

Find the XLM based baseline Model [link](https://github.com/amzn/multiconer-baseline). Please perform multilingual training on these dataset. Number of training data will be more than one for multilingual training.

### XNLI The Cross-Lingual NLI Corpus:
https://github.com/facebookresearch/XNLI

AI4Bharat Winograd Natural Language Inference
* The Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI) corpus is a crowd-sourced collection of 5,000 test and 2,500 dev pairs for the MultiNLI corpus. 
* 14 languages: French, Spanish, German, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Turkish, Arabic, Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Hindi, Swahili and Urdu. 
* This results in 112.5k annotated pairs.
* Members: 3-4 members

Please train the base model  [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) and [XLM](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) using English data, then evaluate the model low-resource dev dataset. You can consider the task as a classification task. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification).

### IndicNLP News Article Classification:
https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indicnlp_corpus#indian-news-article-classification-dataset

Task: Tag a particular news article headline with their news category. Max 4 categories, Min 2 categories
* 7 languages: [Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu]
* Members: 3-4 members

Use [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) and [XLM](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) models for baseline, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification).  

### SemEval 2022 Task 8: Multilingual News Article Similarity
https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/33835

Task: Given a pair of news articles, are they covering the same news story?
* Document-level similarity task, aim is to rate articles pairwise on a 4-point scale from most to least similar.
* Languages: [English, Spanish, German, Polish, Turkish, Arabic, French]
* Data:  4,964 pairs of news articles from above mentioned languages. Contains cross-lingual pairs and additional monolingual data.
* Members: 4-5 members

Use [mBERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) and [XLM](https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base) models for baseline, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification).  For multilingual training, you can use more than one language.

## Rules of the Shared Task
* All solutions should be self-coded, plagiarism is strictly prohibited and strict action will be taken against the entire team found plagiarizing. Solutions from any current repository, any blog or any source on the internet is included in this.
* While your solution is not expected to be the best, we want to see the unique solutions you create in terms of features used, improvements made, extensive result analysis etc. 
* Regular discussions with a TA or PG sir are expected and encouraged. There would be bonus marks for this.
* Marks will be allotted based on ranking on the leaderboard, innovative ideas, and understanding of tasks and models involved. While the leaderboard will be present and you are encouraged to view it as a competition, final marks will not depend only on your ranking. We will also evaluate the efforts and the approach the team has made.
* For each task there would be a separate leaderboard.
* For a task, no more than 5 teams can join.
